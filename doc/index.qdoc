    \title Neuronify

    Neuronify is an educational app for studying neural networks.
    The engine is based on an integrate-and-fire model.

    The distance between \\((x_1,y_1)\\) and \\((x_2,y_2)\\) is
    \\( \\sqrt{(x_2-x_1)^2+(y_2-y_1)^2} \\).

    For a comprehensive list, see \l{All Classes}.

    For a list of qmlTypes, see \l{QML Types}
