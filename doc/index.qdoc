    \title Neuronify

    Neuronify is an educational app for studying neural networks.
    The engine is based on an integrate-and-fire model.

    \section1 Getting started

    Neuronify can be downloaded for multiple platforms.
    Mobile versions of Neuronify will be available soon in Google Play and
    Apple App Store.

    For Mac and Windows users, Neuronify may be downloaded here:
