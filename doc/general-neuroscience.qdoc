\title General neuroscience

The simulations in Neuronify mimic neural networks in our body.
This page is intended to give you a short introduction to basic concepts
of neuroscience that you might encounter while using the app.
In the future, this information may become part of Neuronify itself.

\section1 Brain tissue and cell types

Neocortex is the outer part of our brain.
It is the big part of the brain that is underlying our skull.
It is about 1-4 millimeters thick and consists of six layers.
Each layer has some characteristic properties,
but there are several connections between the layers.

In regular cortical tissue, there are two types of cells:
Neurons and glia cells.
Neuronify focuses solely on the neurons.
Glia cells are traditionally known as helper cells, but recent research
shows that they might be playing a bigger role in signal processing than
previously thought.

The morphology of a neuron, i.e. its shape, is typically divded into three
main parts:
Dendrites, soma and axon.
The dendrites receive input from other cells, which then travels through the
cell body, known as the soma, before its projected out through the axon
towards connections to other cells.
These connections are known as synapses.

There are about 15-20 billion neurons in the human neocortex, with about
1000 - 10000 synapses per neuron.
In total, that means there are about \\(10^{14}\\) connections between neurons in total.
Neuronify is only capable of simulating a tiny fraction of these in about a
thousand of real time speed.
Other simulators can give valuable results from millions of neurons on
a desktop computer.
These simulators are typically not used for educational purposes alone,
but rather for research on large-scale networks.

\section1 Electrical properties of neurons

The neuronal membrane is made of a lipid bilayer.
This is made of two layers of lipid molecules.
The molecules are phospholipids with a hydrophilic head and a hydrophobic tail.
In water, the phospholipids arrange themselves so that the tails of one layer
is directed towards the tails of the other layer.
The hydrophilic heads are pointing towards the water.
This bilayer structure allows almost no water and very few other molecules to
enter and thus becomes a protective sheet that separates the interior of a cell
from its environment.

\section2 Ion channels and pumps

Ion channels are proteins that are located in the cell membrane, passing
through the lipid bilayer.
Certain molecules are able to enter and leave the cells through these channels.

Some ion channels are voltage sensitive, meaning that they open or close
depending on the voltage difference between the inside and outside of the cell.
Others react with neurotransmitter molecules in the extracellular or
intracellular fluids.

Another type of channels are simply passive.
They are always open, but may still be selective to specific types of ions and
molecules.

Ion pumps are energy consuming proteins that actively pump ions in and out
of the cell.
Unlike the ion channels, ion pumps are able to move ions against their
concentration gradient.
They are, among other things, responsible for maintaining the resting
membrane potential.

\section2 Resting membrane potential

The potential difference over the membrane of a neuron is determined by the
charge concentration on each side of the membrane.
This is in turn depends on the flow of charge through the ion channels.

The resting membrane potential is defined as the membrane potential of a neuron
at rest.
The main mechanism behind the resting membrane potential comes from an initial
concentration difference between the inside and outside of the cell membrane.
For simplicity, let's assume that the cell exterior has a high sodium (Na+)
and chloride (Cl-) concentration.
The inside of the cell, on the other hand, has a high potassium (K+) and general
anion (An-) concentration.

Let's assume that the cell membrane only has potassium ion channels open.
This would allow only the potassium to leave the cell.
Due to the concentration gradient, some potassium would leave the cell due to
diffusion.
However, as soon as the potassium starts to leave the cell, an electric
gradient would start building up.
When the force from the concentration gradient and the force from the electric
field are equal, no more potassium would leave the cell.
This would be an equilibrium, or resting, state.

The above mechanism is only one of the driving forces behind the resting
membrane potential.
Ion pumps and other ion channels are also involved in this process.
Particularly important is the Na+-K+ pump that pumps sodium back out of cells
and K+ into the cells.
Considering only the above process of potassium leaving this cell, this may
seem counter-intuitive, as we already see that potassium will leave the
cell because of the concentration gradient.
However, as we will see later, this is necessary to prepare the action
potential - the main player in neuron signaling.

Electrogenic pumps are those that create a net movement of charge over the
cell membrane.

At any given time, even during activity, the membrane potential is driven
towards the resting membrane potential by the above mechanisms.
This means that even after a long stretch of activity, the neuron will return
to the resting membrane potential.

In neurons, the resting membrane potential is typically around -70 mV.

\section1 Nernst-Planck equation

To put numbers on the above ion movement through the ion channels, we need to
take a closer look at the electrical force and the diffusion force.
These both contribute to the total flux of particles through the cell membrane.
This flux is given by the Nernst-Planck equation, which we will give a
simplified derivation of in this section.

\section2 Electrical drift

Charged particles are subject to an electric force when in an electric field:

\raw HTML
\[ \mathbf F_E = q \mathbf E \]
\endraw

We will change the notation slightly, because it's customary to write charge
with a big \\(Z\\) in chemistry:

\raw HTML
\[ \mathbf F_E = Z \mathbf E \]
\endraw

The electric field is the gradient of the potential:

\raw HTML
\[ \mathbf F_E = Z \nabla V \]
\endraw

With no other external forces, the mean drift of a charged particle is equal
to this force:

\raw HTML
\[ \mathbf F_E = \frac{1}{\mu} \mathbf v_\mathrm{drift} \]
\endraw

Here \\( \\mu \\) is the friction from collision with other particles.
The two expression for \\( F_E \\) may be joined to one equation:

\raw HTML
\[ Z \nabla V = \frac{1}{\mu} \mathbf v_\mathrm{drift} \]
\endraw

The Einstein relation is

\raw HTML
\[ \mu = \frac{D}{k_B T}, \]
\endraw

\raw HTML
where \( k_B \) is Boltzmann's constant, \( T \) is the temperature and
\( D \) is the diffusion constant for the given species.
\endraw

We then get the drift velocity as

\raw HTML
\[ \mathbf v_\mathrm{drift} = \frac{Z \nabla V D}{k_B T}. \]
\endraw

The flux is the velocity times the number concentration (number of particles
per volume) \\( c \\):

\raw HTML
\[ \mathbf j_\mathrm{drift} = \frac{Z c D}{k_B T} \nabla V. \]
\endraw

This is the electric contribution to the flux.

\section2 Diffusion

The diffusive flux is given by Fick's law:

\raw HTML
\[ \mathbf j_\mathrm{diff} = - D \nabla c. \]
\endraw

For a derivation of this, see for instance the
\l{http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fick%27s_laws_of_diffusion#Derivation_of_Fick.27s_laws}
{Wikipedia article on Fick's law}.

\section2 Concentrations in moles

It is customary to write the flux in terms of concentrations in moles, rather
than regular numbers.
Further, we replace Boltzmann's constant with the gas constant and Faraday's
constant:

\raw HTML
\[ \mathbf J_\mathrm{drift} = \frac{Z F D}{R T} [X] \nabla V. \]
\[ \mathbf J_\mathrm{diff} = - D \nabla [X]. \]
\endraw

Here \\( [X] \\) is the concentration of species \\( X \\) in moles.

\section2 Total flux

If we sum the two contributions to the flux, we get the Nernst-Planck equation:

\raw HTML
\begin{align}
\mathbf J &= J_\mathrm{diff} + \mathbf J_\mathrm{drift} \\
          &= - D \left ( \nabla [\mathrm{X}]
               - \frac{Z F}{R T} [\mathrm{X}] \nabla V \right )
\end{align}
\endraw

\section2 Nernst potential

We assume that only one species is free to move so that we can treat all
other as a static background electric field.
The Nernst potential is then given when there is no net flux of the given
species.
This can be found by setting the Nernst-Planck equation to zero, i.e. no net
flux.
Further, we focus only on the potential difference in one direction, the
\\( x \\)-direction.

\raw HTML
\begin{align}
\int_{x_1}^{x_2} \frac{1}{[\mathrm X]} \frac{d[\mathrm X]}{dx} \, dx
&= \frac{Z F}{R T} \int_{x_1}^{x_2} \frac{dV}{dx} \, dx \\
\int_{[\mathrm X]_1}^{[\mathrm X]_2} \frac{1}{[\mathrm X]} d[\mathrm X]
&= \frac{Z F}{R T} \int_{V_1}^{V_2} dV \\
\ln \frac{[\mathrm X]_2}{[\mathrm X]_1}
&= \frac{Z F}{R T} (V_2 - V_1) \\
E_{\mathrm X}
&= \frac{R T}{Z F} \ln \frac{[\mathrm X]_2}{[\mathrm X]_1}.
\end{align}
\endraw

\raw HTML
The potential difference \( E_{\mathrm X} = V_2 - V_1 \) is known as the Nernst
potential for the species \( \mathrm X \).
\endraw

\section1 Goldman-Hodgkin-Katz equations

When multiple ion species are involved, we need to expand on the formalism
outlined above.
We assume that the ions cross the membrane independently and that the electric
field within the membrane is constant.
As above, the movement of the ions is governed by the electric field and
the concentration gradient across the membrane.
For each ion, we have the flux as

\raw HTML
\begin{align}
\mathbf J_\mathrm{X}
  &= J_\mathrm{X,diff} + \mathbf J_\mathrm{X,drift} \\
  &= - D \left ( \frac{d [\mathrm{X}]}{dx}
         - \frac{Z F}{R T} [X] \frac{dV}{dx} \right )
\end{align}
\endraw

From our assumption of a constant electric field inside the membrane, we get

\raw HTML
\begin{align}
\mathbf J_\mathrm{X}
  &= J_\mathrm{X,diff} + \mathbf J_\mathrm{X,drift} \\
  &= - D \left ( \frac{d [\mathrm{X}]}{dx}
         - \frac{Z F}{R T} [X] \frac{E_\mathrm{m}}{L} \right )
\end{align}
\endraw

\raw HTML
where \(E_\mathrm{m}\) is the membrane potential and \(L\) is the membrane
thickness.
\endraw

By separation of variables, we obtain

\raw HTML
\begin{align}
dx &= \frac{d[\mathrm X]}
        {-\frac{J_\mathrm{X}}{D_X}
           + \frac{D_\mathrm{X} Z_\mathrm{X} F}{RT} [\mathrm{X}] \frac{E_\mathrm{m}}{L}}.
\end{align}
\endraw

Integration on both sides from \\(x\\) inside the membrane to outside the
membrane gives the solution

\raw HTML
\begin{align}
J_\mathrm{X} = P_\mathrm{X} Z_\mathrm{X} \mu
    \left (
        \frac{[X]_\mathrm{out} - e^{Z_\mathrm{X}\mu} [X]_{\mathrm{in}} }
            {1 - e^{\mu Z_\mathrm{X}}}
    \right),
\end{align}
\endraw

where

\raw HTML
\[ \mu = \frac{FE_\mathrm{m}}{RT}. \]
\endraw

and

\raw HTML
\[ P_\mathrm{X} = \frac{D_\mathrm{X}}{L}. \]
\endraw

is the permeability of the membrane to ion \\(\\mathrm{X}\\).

This equation may now be solved for the membrane potential \\(E_\\mathrm{m}\\).
How to solve it depends on the valency of the ions involved.
In the simplest case, where all involved ions are monovalent so that
\\(Z_\\mathrm{X} = \\pm 1 \\), the solution becomes

\raw HTML
\[
E_\mathrm{m}
  = \frac{RT}{F} \ln
    \frac{\sum_\mathrm{cations C} P_\mathrm{C} [\mathrm{C}^+]_\mathrm{out}
            + \sum_\mathrm{anions A} P_\mathrm{A}[\mathrm{A}^-]_\mathrm{in}}
         {\sum_\mathrm{cations C} P_\mathrm{C} [\mathrm{C}^+]_\mathrm{in}
            + \sum_\mathrm{anions A} P_\mathrm{A}[\mathrm{A}^-]_\mathrm{out}}
\]
\endraw

Inserting the concentrations and permabilites into this equation yields
the equilibrium membrane potential.

Note that the notion of the permeability predates the discovery of ion channels.
The permeability is therefore dependent on the number of ion channels that are
open and may vary with time in active membranes.

\section1 Neuron signaling

Within a neuron, a propagating signal is known as an action potential.
The action potential is driven by ion channels that allow different charges
to flow through.

A synapse may be chemical or electrical, depending on its function.
In a chemical synapse, the presynaptic neuron (sender) emits
neurotransmitters (molecules) that activate reactive sites on the
postsynaptic (receiver) neuron.
In an electrical synapse, the two neurons are interconnected with
shared ion channels.
This keeps the contents of the intracellular fluid of the two neurons in
sync.
Functionally, the biggest difference between electrical and chemical
synapses is in speed and amplification.
Chemical synapses can amplify signals, while electrical synapses are much
faster.
In Neuronify we deal mainly with chemical synapses.
However, note that current clamps and similar items inject current directly
into a receiving neuron, rather than to trigger its synapse.

Neurons may be either excitatory or inhibitory.
Excitatory neurons have synapses that increase the membrane potential of the
postsynaptic neuron.
Inhibitory neurons decrease the membrane potential.
About 80 % of the cortical neurons are excitatory, while 20 % of the neurons
are inhibitory.
