\title General neuroscience

The simulations in Neuronify mimic neural networks in our body.
This page is intended to give you a short introduction to basic concepts
of neuroscience that you might encounter while using the app.
In the future, this information may become part of Neuronify itself.

\section1 Brain tissue and cell types

Neocortex is the outer part of our brain.
It is the big part of the brain that is underlying our skull.
It is about 1-4 millimeters thick and consists of six layers.
Each layer has some characteristic properties,
but there are several connections between the layers.

In regular cortical tissue, there are two types of cells:
Neurons and glia cells.
Neuronify focuses solely on the neurons.
Glia cells are traditionally known as helper cells, but recent research
shows that they might be playing a bigger role in signal processing than
previously thought.

The morphology of a neuron, i.e. its shape, is typically divded into three
main parts:
Dendrites, soma and axon.
The dendrites receive input from other cells, which then travels through the
cell body, known as the soma, before its projected out through the axon
towards connections to other cells.
These connections are known as synapses.

There are about 15-20 billion neurons in the human neocortex, with about
1000 - 10000 synapses per neuron.
This results in about 10ยนโด connections between neurons in total.
Neuronify is only capable of simulating a tiny fraction of these in about a
thousand of real time speed.
Other simulators can give valuable results from millions of neurons on
a desktop computer.
These simulators are typically not used for educational purposes alone,
but rather for research on large-scale networks.

\section1 Neuron signaling

Within a neuron, a propagating signal is known as an action potential.
The action potential is driven by ion channels that allow different charges
to flow through.
Some ion channels are voltage sensitive, meaning that they open or close
depending on the voltage difference between the inside and outside of the cell.
Others react with neurotransmitter molecules in the extracellular or
intracellular fluids.
Another type of channels are simply passive.
They are always open, but may be selective to specific types of ions or
molecules.

A synapse may be chemical or electrical, depending on its function.
In a chemical synapse, the presynaptic neuron (sender) emits
neurotransmitters (molecules) that activate reactive sites on the
postsynaptic (receiver) neuron.
In an electrical synapse, the two neurons are interconnected with
shared ion channels.
This keeps the contents of the intracellular fluid of the two neurons in
sync.
Functionally, the biggest difference between electrical and chemical
synapses is in speed and amplification.
Chemical synapses can amplify signals, while electrical synapses are much
faster.
In Neuronify we deal mainly with chemical synapses.
However, note that current clamps and similar items inject current directly
into a receiving neuron, rather than to trigger its synapse.

Neurons may be either excitatory or inhibitory.
Excitatory neurons have synapses that increase the membrane potential of the
postsynaptic neuron.
Inhibitory neurons decrease the membrane potential.
About 80 % of the cortical neurons are excitatory, while 20 % of the neurons
are inhibitory.
These numbers are debated, because they depend on the way neurons are counted
(by mass, number, etc.) and the techniques used to map the different neurons.
Therefore, results from some labs differ from the above numbers.
